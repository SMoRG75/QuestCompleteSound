QuestCompleteSound can automatically track newly accepted quests â€” if you want it to.

ðŸ”§ Enable or disable

You control this feature with a simple chat command:

/qcs autotrack on   â€“ Enable automatic tracking for new quests
/qcs autotrack off  â€“ Disable automatic tracking
/qcs autotrack      â€“ Show current state

When enabled, any quest you accept will automatically appear in your quest tracker on the right side of the screen.

ðŸ’¾ Saved setting

Your choice is remembered between sessions using the addonâ€™s saved variables â€” so you only need to set it once.

ðŸ§  Notes

If you already have 25 quests tracked (the Blizzard limit), new ones cannot be tracked automatically.

Works on both Retail and Classic clients.

Can be safely toggled on or off at any time during gameplay.
