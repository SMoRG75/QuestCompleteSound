# 🧭 QuestCompleteSound (QCS)

**QuestCompleteSound** makes your questing more immersive.  
It plays a sound when a quest is ready to turn in — and can optionally color quest progress messages (like “7/8 Wolves Slain”) in **red → yellow → green** based on how close you are to completion.

Compatible only with **Retail**.
